## Overview of the Project 
The scope of this research encompasses an in-depth exploration of Verilog language and the development of algorithms tailored for arithmetic and logical operations optimized for hardware implementation. These meticulously crafted algorithms serve as crucial functional blocks within the 
architecture of a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor. To ensure their effectiveness and reliability, these algorithms are meticulously encoded in VERILOG and rigorously tested through comprehensive simulation using the ISE Xilinx simulator. The experimental outcomes underscore 
the viability of our modeling approach, while also providing valuable insights into the performance characteristics of a 16-bit RISC Processor design. Leveraging these results, we have successfully demonstrated the feasibility of our modeling 
strategy and have established key performance metrics for our processor design. In summary, this research venture delves into VERILOG language and algorithm development for hardwareoptimized arithmetic and logical operations, with a particular 
focus on their integration within a RISC processor architecture. The rigorous validation through simulation, synthesis, and subsequent implementation on FPGA platforms underscores the practical applicability of the proposed approach, promising 
versatile solutions for a range of computing scenarios, from general-purpose applications to specialized customer-specific integrated circuits

## Processor Architecture

Architechture 
The architecture of the proposed RISC CPU is a uniform 
16-bit instruction format, single cycle processor. It has a 
load/store architecture, where the operations will only be 
performed on registers, and not on memory locations. It 
follows the classical von Neumann architecture with just one 
common memory bus for both instructions and data 
To achieve a 16-Bit CPU design, the individual 
components are designed as below.
1. ALU
2. Arithmetic Unit
3. Logic Unit
4. Data Memory
5. Instruction memory
6. Program Counter
7. Instruction Register
8. Multiplexer
9. Controller
10. CPU
